# Authereum
Have certifications all over the place? Need to quickly verify credentials? Authereum is your best bet.

## Inspiration
Imagine you're a hiring company. This year you have hundreds of thousands of applicants, all of whom have outstanding credentials and online certifications from websites like Coursera, edX, etc.

How, then, can you verify the authenticity of all these certificates?

The answer is the blockchain-based governance system. Our product, Authereum, solves this problem by effectively putting certificates on the blockchain, so that any company can verify its authenticity.
